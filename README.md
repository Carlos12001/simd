# Computer Architecture 2 - S1 - 2024
## Project 1 - SIMD Architecture for Audio Signal Processing through FIR Filtering


The microarchitecture implemented for the solution is based in a 32-bits pipelined MIPS processor. The diagram of the base MIPS implementation is shown in the following image, but it can be review with better detail level in [this draw.io link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JE9gU0IdZoLkoXOKma_DnDohI6xbLTQO).
